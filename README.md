H1 Spotify Web Playback SDK

I am following a tutorial to learn more about the Spotify Web Playback SDK
[Tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/)

* SDK ==> Software Development Kit;
* Oxford Definition: a set of tools for third-party developers to use in producing applications using a particular framework or platform.

* I used dotenv and created a .env file to run locally to conceal my Access Token - this didn't work because I couldn't use "require" or "import". I had to insert my Access code directly

* I was able to get the Quick Start version of the app started. Now my next step is to create V2 where I recreate the app with the Authorization flow so I don't have to manually update with a new code every hour.
